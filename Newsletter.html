    <p>A day after its fourth straight loss, the team posted a message from president Glen Sather and general manager Jeff Gorton to fans on its website and Twitter on Thursday, hinting strongly that big-name veterans will be shipped off for prospects and draft picks as the deadline approaches.</p> <div class="inside"><img src="z-gorton.jpg" alt="Gorton"></div> 
	<p>The second half of the third paragraph reads, "As we approach the trade deadline later this month and into the summer, we will be focused on adding young, competitive players that combine speed, skill and character. This may mean we lose some familiar faces, guys we all care about and respect. While this is part of the game, it's never easy. Our promise to you is that our plans will be guided by our singular commitment: ensuring we are building the foundation for our next Stanley Cup contender. Among those who could potentially be dealt are leading goal scorer Michael Grabner and 15th-year veteran Rick Nash</p> 

	<p>So how much of the Rangers’ struggles throughout the season were directly a result of Alain Vigneault’s decision making? The best way to determine that is by looking at New York’s performance throughout the season, pinpointing what they struggled at that lead to their downfall, and determining whether those issues were player or coach driven.</p>
